This year, we're celebrating with six limited edition anniversary models and one exclusive custom vehicle. Each model features unique paint schemes and graphics inspired by the 1933 V.L.D. Speed bird. The base color on all models is heirloom red, modernized with advanced painting technology. These motorcycles are not just vehicles, they're pieces of art, each marked with a unique serial number tag. The anniversary collection is a perfect blend of tradition and contemporary styling, a testament to Harley Davidson's rich heritage. Join us in celebrating 120 years of building and riding great motorcycles.\""
