    "response": "Welcome to the 120th anniversary of Harley Davidson, marking a legacy of excellence and innovation. This year, we're celebrating with six limited edition anniversary models and one exclusive custom vehicle operations model. Inspired by the art deco features of the 1933 V.L.D. Speedbird, our designers have crafted unique and dynamic anniversary motorcycle designs. The base color on all anniversary models is heirloom red, modernized with advanced painting technology. Each motorcycle is marked with a unique serial number tag, adding exclusivity. These motorcycles are not just vehicles, they're a celebration of 120 years of Harley Davidson's rich heritage.",
