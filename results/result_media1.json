    "response": "Welcome to the 120th anniversary of Harley Davidson, marking 120 years of motorcycle excellence. To celebrate, we're introducing six limited edition anniversary models, each featuring unique designs inspired by our rich heritage. Our designers have revisited the art deco features of the 1933 V.L.D. Speedbird, resulting in a modernized paint palette and advanced painting technology. The base color, heirloom red, is a nod to our past, while the use of state-of-the-art fade techniques represents our innovative present. Each model is marked with a unique serial number, adding to their exclusivity. Join us in celebrating 120 years of Harley Davidson with these head-turning, limited edition motorcycles."
