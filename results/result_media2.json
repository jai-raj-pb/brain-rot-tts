    "response": "Introducing the 2023 Harley Davidson Breakout, the most powerful to date. Powered by the Milwaukee A 117 engine, it drives a fat 240mm rear tire for a muscular presence. It comes in vivid colors like black denim and Baha orange. The high-performance camshaft and heavy breather intake maximize performance and give it a hot rod presence. It features a new five-gallon fuel tank, chrome finishes, and 26-spoke cast aluminum wheels. The handlebar is taller for improved control and comfort. It's loaded with modern technology like LED headlamp, digital tech gauge, and a keyless ignition system. The Breakout is a worthy inclusion in the Harley Davidson 2023 lineup.",
