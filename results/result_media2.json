    "response": "Introducing the 2023 Harley Davidson Breakout, the most powerful to date. It's powered by the Milwaukee A 117 engine, driving a fat 240mm rear tire. The high-performance camshaft and heavy breather intake maximize performance, while the two-into-two offset shotgun exhaust provides a classic Harley Davidson sound. The Breakout comes in vivid colors, with chrome finishes and 26-spoke cast aluminum wheels. It features a new handlebar riser for improved control and comfort, and a five-gallon fuel tank. It's loaded with modern technology like LED headlamp, digital tech gauge, and a keyless ignition system. The Breakout, a perfect blend of performance and style, is a standout in the 2023 Harley Davidson lineup."
