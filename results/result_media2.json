    "response": "Introducing the 2023 Harley Davidson Breakout, the most powerful to date. It's powered by the Milwaukee A 117 engine, driving a fat 240mm rear tire. With high-performance camshaft and heavy breather intake, it offers exciting midrange torque. It comes in vivid colors, with chrome finishes and 26-spoke cast aluminum wheels. The new handlebar riser improves rider control and comfort. It features a 49mm fork with dual bending valve technology, ABS, cruise control, and traction control system. It's equipped with modern technology like a signature LED headlamp, digital tech gauge, USB charging outlet, and keyless ignition. The Breakout is a perfect blend of performance and style, a worthy addition to the Harley Davidson 2023 lineup.",
