We'll be discussing the Ola S1 family and S1 Air family, their specifications, features, and sales pitches. \n\nThe Ola S1 family, with its powerful 8.5 kW motor, offers the best design, technology, and performance in scooters. The family includes the Ola S1 Pro, Ola S1 with a 3 kWh battery, and Ola S1 with a 2 kWh battery. \n\nThe S1 Air family, designed for affordability without compromising on technology, includes the Ola S1 Air with 4 kWh, 3 kWh, and 2 kWh battery options. \n\nThe new Ola S1 with a 2 kWh battery is perfect for daily commutes, offering great acceleration and performance at a more affordable price due to its smaller battery pack. \n\nWe're also introducing the Ola S1 Air in three variants, featuring a 34L boot space, sculpted seat, grab handle, flat footboard, dual front suspension, and dual-tone body. \n\nSales pitches vary based on customer needs. For those seeking high performance and range, the S1 Pro is ideal. For daily commutes of 20-30 kilometers, the S1 with a 2 kWh battery is a perfect fit. And for those seeking affordability, the S1 Air offers great design and technology at a competitive price. \n\nThank you for joining this training module on the Ola Scooter family."
